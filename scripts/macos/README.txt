Hookshot Builder for macOS (Apple Silicon)

This package includes a native arm64 macOS app and command-line builder that use
WebGPU's Metal backend. It includes Hookshot source, Python
runtime and modules, SDL2, static FFmpeg libraries, and wgpu-native.

It does not include game data or a built game. You must provide your own
legally obtained .nup dump. Xcode Command Line Tools are required on the Mac
where you build.
The generated executable requires macOS 13.3 or newer.

Double-click HookshotBuilder.app to open the Hookshot Builder interface. It
matches the existing builder flow: choose your dump and output folder, then
watch the build progress. For command-line use, run:

  ./HookshotBuilder.command --nup /path/to/your-game.nup --out /path/to/output

Add --jobs 2 (or another suitable value) to limit parallel compiler memory use.
The output folder contains the built game. Keep this builder package available
if you later use the builder's --update option.
